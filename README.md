# Welcome to Velo Kickstart
- [**Project Steps**](STEPS.md) - Detailed instruction for each step of the todo app project

## Abstract

The karate kid kickstart is an intense, almost entirely self learnt,  karate kid style (wash in, wash out) 13 steps program for front end developers where the trainee has to write the same app over and over from scratch. Starting from the most simple vanilla JS through writing a simple server with a DB, learning about webpack, flex css, localstorage, cookies, https, jwt, tests, react and much more.

The trainee also learns how to deploy their app to production via a standalone service (heroku for example).

The final project is a fully deployed TDD written app on top of yoshi, WSR and wix ci.

## How to work with this repo (READ ME!)

1. You should fork this repo into a **private** repo and start working on the steps. The folder structure should look something like this:
[folder structure](assets/karate-kid-folder-structure.png)
2. All commits should be done as a PR. This is important so the mentor can do code review even after the fact (after a PR was merged so it won't block the trainee) 
3. After each step is completed the mentor should do the most comperhensive and harsh code review they can possibly do. The success of this program is mostly relies on good and teaching code reviews. 
4. After each code review the trainee is expected to fix all comments.
5. You should advance to the next step only after all the code review rejects has been fixed. In case the trainee is blocked by the mentor they should fill their time by learning and gaining more knowledge either by reading / watching videos / practicing katas / etc.. ideas can be found [here]()

## Book report
Before we begin the actual training, we should take 1-2 days exploring wix and what it has to offer. The idea behind the "book report" is to get to know wix as a product. Once you will start your day to day work you will probably focus on a specific area/product inside of wix. Take this time to explore. 

Here are some products you can/should play with:
* Stores
* App market
* Events
* Bookings
* Automations
* Invoices
* Forms
* Chat
* Contacts
* Velo project - find a small project that will help you in your lifea and implement it using velo. For example, [here's](https://www.parkingstatus.info/) a website that shows the parking lots status in TLV's old north neighborhood (if you want to change the parking lot that it shows u can add `parkingIds` param and specify the parking lot that u want)
